# Architecture Planning

Discussion of DTF Software Architecture Repo

    - Application for Healthcare Workers - MAP w/ Data Transparency Score (DTS) - create mockup w/ react - **WIP**
    - Data Models for Storing Factors - 
    - Query Resource Databases - compile list

    - Verified Real-Time Data Guaranteed Via Smart Contract  
    - Secure File Storage with Agile Referencing  

use **JS** based tech

    - NodeJS - https://github.com/nodejs/node
    - SQL - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/a-public-data-lake-for-analysis-of-covid-19-data/   
    - IPFS-JS - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs
    - ReactJS - https://github.com/facebook/react

**UI** - web dashboard (world map)  

    - Google Maps API  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-map-react
    - HTML5  
    - Google Maps Reach Component gives us a lot of functionality for free but is not open source
    - new forked https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/articles/how-to-write-a-google-maps-react-component/

**IPFS** for storage  

    - Hash Based Linking  
    - Secure SHA Encryption  
    - Scalable File Structure
    
**ZK-snarks**

    - TODO:
        Determine whether we should use zero knowledge proofs to preserve user privacy
        Review ZKP presentation: 

# Resources

COVID-19 data sets provided by AWS: <- need to query Amazon COVID-19 data lake w/ SQL.
